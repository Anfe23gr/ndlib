Who uses NDlib?
---------------

The potential audience for ``NDlib`` includes mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, and social scientists. 

-----
Goals
-----

``NDlib`` is built upon the ``NetworkX`` python library and is intended to provide:

- tools for the study diffusion dynamics on social, biological, and infrastructure networks,
- a standard programming interface and diffusion models implementation that is suitable for many applications,
- a rapid development environment for collaborative, multidisciplinary, projects.

---------------------------
The Python Networkx library
---------------------------

Networkx is a powerful Python package that allows simple and flexible representations of networks, and clear and concise expressions of network algorithms (and other algorithms too). 

Most importantly, Networkx, as well as the Python programming language, is free, well-supported, and a joy to use.
